                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>Frank Sinatra was born December 12, 1915, in Hoboken, New Jersey, to italian immigrants Antonino Sinatra and Natalina Garaventa. He developed an interest in big band jazz at a young age, and was particularly influenced by Bing Crosby. He never graduated from high school, and he worked as a delivery boy and riveter before pursuing his career in music. During his musical career, Sinatra led a colorful personal life and was married four times, first to his childhood sweetheart Nancy Barbato, and then Ava Gardner, Mia Farrow, and Barbara Marx. He had three children with his first wife: Nancy, Frank Jr., and Tina. Sinatra passed away May 14, 1998, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 82.</p>
                <h3>Rise to Fame</h3>
                <p>Starting out as a saloon singer, Sinatra got his first break singing with a local band that was known as the Hoboken Four. He left the Hoboken Four in 1938 and was brought on as the lead singer in Harry James's band in 1939. During this time, his famous record "All or Nothing at All" was released for the first time. His last major role in a band was as lead singer of Tom Dorsey's band. Tom Dorsey was a major influence in Sinatra's life, and he enjoyed great success in Dorsey's band from 1939-1942. In 1942, Sinatra decided to go solo, and his skyrocket to fame began.</p>
                <p>Sinatra went on to release a massive catalogue of crooning hits over the next several decades. During this time, he engendered an avid fanbase of crazed young women that had never been seen before. He signed with Columbia Records in 1943, went on to work with Capital Records in 1953, and then opened his own recording label, Reprise Records, in 1961. During a slump in his success in the 50s, he ventured to Las Vegas, where he quickly became known as one of the best performers among a group of famous artists known as the Rat Pack. During this time, he also enjoyed a successful career as a film actor.</p>
                <h3>Success in Acting</h3>
                <p>Sinatra's acting career blossomed alongside his music career, landing his first lead role in Anchors Aweigh in 1945 alongside Gene Kelly. In film, he is best known for his performances in On the Town (1949), From Here to Eternity (1953), Guys and Dolls (1955), The Man with the Golden Arm (also 1955), and The Manchurian Candidate (1962). In television, he hosted The Frank Sinatra Show from 1950-1952, and played a lead role in a drama series by the same name in 1957/1958. He was also involved in several television specials due to his success and acclaim, with his last role being a guest appearance on Magnum, P.I. in 1988.</p>
                <h3>Legacy</h3>
                <p>Sinatra's overwhelming talent, unique and intimate style, big personality, and widespread appeal earned him a number of well-deserved awards in his lifetime, and he continues to be relevant and adored over twenty years since his death. His legacy in the music and entertainment industry is unquestionable and inspires many artists and fans to this day.</p>
